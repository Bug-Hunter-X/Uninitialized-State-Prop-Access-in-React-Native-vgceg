This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized. This often happens when you try to use a state variable in the render method before the component has mounted or when you try to use a prop that hasn't been passed down yet.  It can also happen due to asynchronous operations where you attempt to use data before it's fetched.

Example:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> {/* Error: data might be null */}
    </View>
  );
};
```
